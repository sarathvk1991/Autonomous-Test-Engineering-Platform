"""NORMALIZATION-0003 — Capture Normalization Observations.

The **third** internal stage of the ``ResponseNormalizer``.  It owns exactly one
concern: capturing the recorded, un-judged ``NormalizationObservation`` facts that
a structural view alone would lose, and appending them to the Assembly State's
transient observation collection — the facts the ``NormalizationResult`` (never the
``ParsedResponse``) will carry.

Responsibility Documentation Contract
-------------------------------------
1. **Purpose** — Capture zero or more ``NormalizationObservation`` facts about the
   run, and append them to the Assembly State for the ``NormalizationResult`` to
   aggregate.
2. **Catalog ID** — ``NORMALIZATION-0003`` (Normalization Responsibility Catalog
   §5; Response Normalization Contract §13).
3. **Inputs** — the result of structure recovery (``0001``), read from
   :attr:`~requirement_intelligence.normalization.response.assembly.assembly_state.AssemblyState.normalized_structure`;
   the determined outcome (``0002``) is read, when present, only as corroborating
   **evidence** for a recorded observation — never as the decision that a fact
   exists (that is derived from ``0001``'s recovery result, this stage's frozen
   dependency — Catalog §5; Assembly Contract §6).
4. **Outputs** — zero or more **Normalization Observations** appended to the
   Assembly State's transient observation collection.  The observations are owned
   by the ``NormalizationResult``; they are **never** carried on the
   ``ParsedResponse`` and are **never** read by NORMALIZATION-0005 (Assembly
   Contract §5, §6; Validation Canonical Models §8.1).
5. **Worked example** — when ``0001`` recorded an **absent** structure, ``0003``
   records one ``malformed_representation`` observation stating *that* the response
   expressed no recoverable well-formed structure (Response Normalization Contract
   §8).  When ``0001`` recovered a structure, ``0003`` records **zero** observations
   — nothing a structural view would lose is derivable from the recovered structure
   alone at this stage — and that is a fully successful result.
6. **Architecture Reference** — ``docs/architecture/normalization-assembly-contract.md``
   §6 (NORMALIZATION-0003); ``docs/architecture/normalization-responsibility-catalog.md``
   §5; ``docs/architecture/normalization-stage-implementation-contract.md``; ADR-0002.

Facts, never judgments (Response Normalization Contract §8, §10)
---------------------------------------------------------------
An observation is a **fact**.  It carries **no severity, no verdict, no
recommendation, and no blocking indicator** — those are validation judgments across
the frozen §10 boundary.  A later validation rule may *read* an observation and
*decide* to raise a ``ValidationIssue``; that decision belongs entirely to
validation.  A ``NormalizationObservation`` is **never itself** a ``ValidationIssue``.

Single concern — what it never does
-----------------------------------
It **never** recovers structure (``0001``), determines the outcome (``0002``),
creates the source reference (``0004``), assembles the ``ParsedResponse``
(``0005``), validates, judges, repairs, coordinates, or mutates the ``LLMResponse``.
It writes **only** observations.

Why it has no injected collaborator
-----------------------------------
Like NORMALIZATION-0002 — and unlike NORMALIZATION-0001 — this stage takes **no**
injected collaborator: the facts it records are fixed by architecture (Response
Normalization Contract §8), so there is no varying *mechanism* to inject.  The
observation identifier is derived deterministically from the stage's identity, and
the timestamp is taken from the platform's shared clock helper, exactly as the
frozen validation subsystem stamps a ``ValidationIssue``'s ``created_at`` — no
speculative time/identity abstraction is introduced (Stage Implementation Contract
§9.2).

Determinism (Stage Implementation Contract §4)
----------------------------------------------
The **semantic content** of every observation — which observations are recorded,
their type, and their detail — is a deterministic function of the upstream facts.
The observation's identity and timestamp are run-scoped **execution metadata**
carried by the ``NormalizationResult`` (an execution fact about the run), not part
of the deterministic canonical ``ParsedResponse`` — so stamping ``created_at`` from
the shared clock is consistent with determinism, exactly as it is for a
``ValidationIssue``.

Facts, not exceptions (Assembly Contract §8)
--------------------------------------------
Recording a ``malformed_representation`` observation — or recording **no**
observation at all — is a **fact**; zero observations is a successful result.  The
stage raises
:class:`~requirement_intelligence.normalization.response.assembly.stage_exceptions.ObservationCaptureError`
**only** for an infrastructure/ordering failure: it was invoked before
NORMALIZATION-0001 recorded the structure it depends on (Assembly Contract §7).
