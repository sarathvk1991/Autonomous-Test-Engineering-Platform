"""Canonical, immutable models for Quality Rule Evaluation (CAP-080A.1).

Rule Evaluation is the layer *between* the governed ``QualityPolicy`` and the
governance decision: it evaluates each governed rule against the completed upstream
results and records **observations only** — never a quality score, a release
decision, or a governance summary (ADR-0017 Recommendation 4 / D18).

Two canonical models carry it:

* :class:`RuleEvaluation` — one evaluated governance rule (its status and the values
  that explain it).
* :class:`RuleEvaluationResult` — the frozen **runtime contract** between the
  ``QualityRuleEvaluator`` and the ``QualityGovernanceService`` (ADR-0017 D19).

All models follow the repository conventions: immutable, ``frozen``,
``extra="forbid"``, camelCase-serialised, tuple-backed, ``Schema`` base, and free of
timestamps/UUIDs on the value objects. They **compute nothing** — the future
evaluator populates them; the only logic here is validator *invariants*.
